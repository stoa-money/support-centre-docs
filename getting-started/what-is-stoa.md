# What is Stoa?

## What is Stoa?

Stoa turns your savings into lifestyle perks – not cash interest. Choose perks across a broad range of categories (like streaming, travel, or everyday brands) and get the value upfront as digital gift cards when you deposit the amount shown. For example, deposit £3,000 with Stoa and enjoy a year of Netflix  on us – worth £155.88 (subject to change – based on a Netflix Standard monthly subscription, assuming £12.99/month over a 12 month period, as of September 2025).

## How does Stoa work?

Stoa turns your savings into lifestyle perks instead of cash interest. You choose the perks you want, make the deposit shown, and we send the digital gift cards upfront once your deposit is confirmed.

### Three easy steps

1. **Pick your Perks** in the web app — we show the required deposit for each.
2. **Make your deposit** — your money is held in your account at Griffin bank (FSCS eligibility and limits apply), that we create on your behalf.
3. **Enjoy the value** — we deliver the gift cards digitally; most arrive quickly, and some require a short manual step (typically <30 minutes during \~8am–11pm UK).

### Where the value comes from

Perks are funded by the interest earned on balances held with Stoa and by partnership arrangements with brands. Instead of paying you cash interest, we convert that value into perks you can use right away.

### Why it's different

* **Upfront value** (gift cards) rather than interest paid over time.
* **Pick what matters** — streaming, travel, lifestyle and more.
* **Clear commitment** — we hold your deposit(s) for 12 months only. At the end of the term, you can choose to renew for a further 12 months, or receive your full deposit back&#x20;

_Note: Perks are non-cash rewards. Tax treatment depends on your circumstances and may change. We don’t provide tax advice._

## What's the catch?

No hidden catches. Pick your Perks, deposit the amount shown, and we’ll send the digital gift cards upfront once your deposit is confirmed.

## How many Perks can I choose?

As many as you like. Your total deposit depends on the combined value of the Perks you select.

* For every [Stoa Pot](the-stoa-glossary.md#stoa-pot) you open, you receive the respective [Perk](the-stoa-glossary.md#perk).
* You can add more Pots later — simply add them to your selection and proceed to the checkout to make another deposit.

## How do I redeem my Perks?

After you select your Perks and make your deposit, we send digital gift cards via the authenticated web app or by email.

1. You will be notified by email when your gift cards are ready. Simply follow the link in the email or go to your _My Pots_ page and click _Reveal_. Depending on the Perk you have selected, you may receive the gift card code via email instead – in which case clicking _Reveal_ will prompt you to check your email.
2. Redeem with the merchant/service following their instructions. We will also provide you with a set of redemption instructions for each Perk.
3. Keep codes safe; most merchants treat them like cash.\
   &#xNAN;_&#x54;ip:_ If you can’t find the email, check spam or your _My Pots_ page.

## What happens if I want to withdraw my deposit?

For all Stoa Pots, your deposit is held for 12 months. Only in extenuating circumstances (such as life-changing events) may we, at our discretion, permit an early withdrawal request.

To raise an early withdrawal request, please contact us at support@stoa.money or call our support line on +44 (0) 20 7959 3836.

## Do I need to pay tax on my Perks?

Stoa Perks are non-cash rewards (digital gift cards). We don’t pay interest. Tax treatment can vary based on your personal situation (for example, how you use Stoa and any rules that apply to you). We can’t give tax advice, so if you’re unsure, please speak to a qualified tax adviser. You’re responsible for reporting any tax that may be due.

## Can I request Perks to be added to Stoa?

Yes — please do. Get in touch with your suggestion and we’ll review it case by case. We’ll let you know if it’s feasible and keep you posted.
