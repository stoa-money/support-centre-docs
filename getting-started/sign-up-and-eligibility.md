# Sign up and eligibility

## Who can open a Stoa Account?

To open a [Stoa Account](the-stoa-glossary.md#stoa-account), we require that:

* You have an existing, UK registered bank account.
* You are a UK resident (and therefore have a UK postal address).
* Your Nationality is in our [List of Supported Countries for Nationality](sign-up-and-eligibility.md#list-of-supported-countries-for-nationality).
* You are above the age of 18.

## What you need to sign up (documents)

You will need a valid Photo ID, such as a Passport or Drivers License. You will be asked to take a selfie and a photo of your ID as part of the onboarding process, so please make sure you are in a comfortable, well-lit environment.

If your identity cannot be verified automatically, it may fall into a manual review process. We might reach out requesting a copy (e.g., electronic copy) of other documents such as a Proof of Address (POA).

## What's the minimum amount of money I need to get started?

The minimum amount of money to open a Stoa Pot fluctuates over time. As of launch, the minimum entry deposit starts from around £1,000.
