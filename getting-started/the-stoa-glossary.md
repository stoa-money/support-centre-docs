# The Stoa Glossary

## Perk

A Perk is the benefit you will receive expressed as the price for a good or service provided by one of the Brands we offer together with the required deposit size.

## Stoa Pot

A Stoa Pot is based on the Perk you choose and links your personal details to the details of that Perk and the associated deposit - it forms the basis of a contract between you and Stoa. A customer can choose any number of Perks and make a similar number of deposits all at once or one at a time. The number of Perks you choose will be equal to the number Pots we create and the number of deposits you have.

## Deposit

A deposit is an amount of money that is required to be added to your Stoa Pots account. Subsequently, you will receive the relevant Perk. **1 Deposit = 1 Stoa Pot = 1 Perk.**

You can make **multiple** deposits in a single transaction payment, which we define as a movement of money from your bank account to your Stoa Pots account. One single transaction payment can represent multiple deposits, therefore.

For example, if Netflix requires a deposit of £3,000 and Ticketmaster requires a deposit of £2,000, you can open a Stoa Pot for each by making a single transaction payment of £5,000. This represents both the £3,000 deposit and the £2,000 deposit, respectively. As a Stoa Pot is its own contract between you and Stoa, each deposit is, by extension, subject to its own terms.

## Your account at Griffin bank

We will open a bank account for you, in your name, at our partner Griffin bank, where your deposits are held. We will only open one bank account for you irrespective of how many Pots you open, and so all your deposits will be held in the same account.

## Stoa Account

When you sign up to Stoa we create an account for you on our platform where you can find all your personal details, view and manage your Pots and select new Perks.

## Confirmation of Payee (CoP)

Confirmation of Payee (CoP) is a payee checking service that helps prevents UK domestic payments from being sent to the wrong account. It does this by making sure the payee account details provided match the details held by their provider.

When you interact with Stoa, a CoP check occurs at the following places:

1. When you connect a bank account to Stoa (Your Connected Bank Account), Stoa carries out a CoP check to verify that the bank account is in your name.
2. When you make a deposit to your Stoa Pots account, your bank may carry out a CoP check to verify that the account is in your name.
