## Is Stoa available 24/7?

The Stoa platform, where you can login to your account, is available 24/7. However, some features depend on banking networks and compliance checks that may pause outside business hours or during maintenance. That can affect when money arrives, when reviews complete, or when a payment shows as settled. If something is pending, it usually clears once the network or review resumes.

Some interactions that may be impacted include:

* **Making a deposit:** Usually minutes, but some banks queue or require manual approval—especially nights/weekends or for first-time/larger amounts.
* **KYC onboarding:** Most applications complete quickly. If manual approval is needed (e.g., name mismatch), allow **up to 2 working days**.
* **Perk delivery (gift cards):** Most are delivered manually by a support agent and usually arrive within 30 minutes. If you open a Stoa Pot **after 11pm UK time (Mon–Sun)**, the gift card may be delivered **after 8am** the next day. Please make sure to watch your inbox (and spam).
