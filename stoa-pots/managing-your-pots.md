# Managing your Pots

## View Pot details

To view the details for a given Pot, simply navigate to your _My Pots_ page and click the relevant _View_ button on the right-hand side.

## Pot Statuses

### Pending

This means that your deposit has been successfully received and your gift card codes are in the process of being acquired. (Please see [here](broken-reference) for gift card delivery estimates).

### Ready

This means that your gift cards have been successfully acquired and are ready for you to redeem. You should receive an email updating you on this. In your _My Pots_ page, you will also notice that the _View_ button has updated to _Activate_. Clicking this will allow you to _Reveal_ your codes – note that, for some brands, it may reveal a message asking you to check your email to find the code.

### Active

This means that you have revealed your gift card codes.

### Expired

This means that your Pot has expired. This happens once the deposit return date has been approached, and so the deposit has been returned to you. This also happens if, for any reason, the Pot is cancelled prematurely (for instance, because your early withdrawal request was approved).

### Pending Deposit

This status is specifically reserved for new Pots that are waiting to receive the full or partial deposit amount, as a result of you accepting an offer.

## What happens at end of term?

Usually 30 days prior to your Pot reaching expiry, you will enter the Offer Acceptance Period. We will reach out to you with a new set of Pots that you can choose to transition your deposit into. This will include:

* A Renewal offer – if you want to continue access to the Perk for another period of time (e.g., an additional 12 months). This may require you to adjust your deposit amount.
* Other or similar offers. You will also have the opportunity to choose an entirely different Perk if you wish to do so. Similarly, this may require you to adjust your deposit amount.

You will have until 3 days prior to your Pot's expiry date to inform us if you wish to accept an offer (as mentioned above, this could be a Renewal offer or one we recommend to you or at your request).

If you do not accept an offer, then your deposit will be returned to you as scheduled, on the deposit return date. It is worth noting that, although the deposit return date is the date on which Stoa submits the payment instruction to Griffin bank to return the deposit to your bank account (where you deposited from), it is not guaranteed to arrive on this exact date. This is because it is subject to external factors outside of Stoa, such as your bank's processing times and checks.

## What happens when I accept the offer?

When you accept an offer, what happens next depends on whether the offer requires you to adjust your deposit size:

### The offer requires a larger deposit

To accept the offer, this requires that you deposit an additional amount, so that the resulting deposit size is sufficient for the new Pot. For example, in the case of a Renewal:

1. Alice's Pot, that provides her with a Perk for Netflix Standard, enters the Offer Acceptance Period (30 days prior to expiry).
2. Alice is presented with a Renewal offer for a new Pot, that will provide her with a Perk for Netflix Standard for an additional 12 month period. The Renewal offer requires a deposit size of £4,000. As Alice's current Pot has a deposit of £3,000, she will need to deposit an additional £1,000 to accept the Renewal offer.
3. Alice accepts the Renewal offer by following the payment screens presented to her and depositing the additional £1,000 amount.
4. Once the additional deposit amount has been received successfully, the new Pot is created for her. The new Pot, at this point, only contains the additional £1,000 deposit amount and is in a special Pending Deposit state.
5. When Alice's original Pot reaches its deposit return date, the deposit is reallocated to the (already created) new Pot. Once this happens, the new Pot moves into a regular Pending state – meaning that the gift cards for it are currently being acquired (just as though she had opened the new Pot regularly). When the gift cards are successfully acquired and distributed to Alice, she can enjoy her Renewal offer of a further 12 month period of Netflix Standard.

### The offer requires a lower deposit

When you accept the offer, we will return to you the difference on the scheduled deposit return date. For example, in the case that Alice accepts another offer:

1. Alice's Pot, that provides her with a Perk for Netflix Standard, enters the Offer Acceptance Period (30 days prior to expiry).
2. Alice chooses that she wants to transition her deposit into a Pot that provides her with a Perk for Spotify Premium for an additional 12 month period. This offer requires a deposit size of £2,000. As Alice's current Pot has a deposit of £3,000, she will receive the £1,000 difference on the scheduled deposit return date.
3. Alice accepts the offer. Upon doing so, the new Pot is created for her immediately. Similarly, this new Pot is in a Pending Deposit state. It is shown to have a deposit of £0, as no deposit has been allocated to it as of yet.
4. When Alice's original Pot reaches its deposit return date, £2,000 from the deposit is reallocated to the (already created) new Pot, and the remaining £1,000 is sent to its originating bank account.
5. Now that the deposit size for the new Pot is sufficient, it moves in to a Pending state, and follows the regular course of action. When the gift cards are successfully acquired and distributed to Alice, she can enjoy her new Perk of Spotify Premium for the next 12 month period.

### The offer requires the same deposit

This flow is identical to when the offer requires a lower deposit with the exception that no deposit difference is returned to Alice (as the difference is £0).
