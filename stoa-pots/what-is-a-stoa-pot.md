# What is a Stoa Pot?

## What is a Stoa Pot?

Please refer to the Glossary definition [here](../getting-started/the-stoa-glossary.md#stoa-pot).

## How is the size of my deposit calculated?

The deposit size for a given perk is based on various factors, and the degree to which any individual factor contributes varies between perks. These factors include:

* Commission received from banking partners on deposits. (At the current moment, only Griffin bank).
* Brand partnership agreements.
* Strategic subsidy initiatives.

## Can I have more than one Pot?

Yes! Not only can you have more than one Pot, but you can open multiple Pots in a single transaction payment. Simply add more than one Pot to your selection, make the required deposits, and enjoy your free perks across your new Pots!

## The price of the Perk shown is not correct

The pricing of the Perk advertised on the Stoa platform is, to the best of our abilities, the most accurate and up-to-date pricing based on public information. This does not include any specific, time-bound promotions that a Brand may run (for example, if a Brand advertises a 50% off sale if a user signs up for an annual subscription in the next week).

If you believe that you have correctly identified that a certain Perk Value is not correct, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at support@stoa.money – including a public link as evidence to the discrepancy.

## Can I terminate a Pot?

Please see [here](../getting-started/what-is-stoa.md#what-happens-if-i-want-to-withdraw-my-deposit) for information on requesting an early withdrawal.

## Can I make a deposit on behalf of someone else?

No. Any deposit must originate from the Connected Bank Account that you have associated with your Stoa Account, which must be in your name.

## Can I gift my Perk to someone else?

For certain Perks gifting is permitted. These are predominantly branded gift cards, where the gift card received is a product of the Brand itself (for example, a Netflix gift card). Perks that are only redeemable via Apple App Store or Google Play Store credit are prohibited for gifting purposes (for example, ChatGPT).

Please refer to the specific Terms & Conditions and Redemption Instructions for a specific Perk for greater clarity, or reach out to our support team for further assistance.

## What happens if I want to add another Stoa Pot that is already active?

You can add as many of the same Stoa Pots as you like for the same Brand. For example, you can have two Perks that grant you Netflix Standard each at the same time that are tied to separate, active Stoa Pots. This can only be achieved when making separate transaction payments, however.

## What happens if a Brand updates its pricing mid-term?

If a Brand updates its pricing whilst you have an active Perk with us for that Brand, then we are happy to review this on a case by case basis, which may involve you receiving the difference accordingly.
