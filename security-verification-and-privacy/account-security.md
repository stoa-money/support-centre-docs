# Account security

## Why do I need to set up Two Factor Authentication (2FA)?

To help prevent unauthorised access to your account, we require that users set up 2FA. This means that, each time you log-in, you are required to enter a unique 6 digit code.

This code updates frequently. You should always keep your mobile device safe, containing your authenticator app.

## I am being asked to authorise a new device?

If you attempt to log-in from a device that you may not have attempted to log-in with previously, we will ask you to authorise the device by entering your 2FA code. This helps prevent unauthorised access by only allowing known devices, such as your mobile device or personal laptop, from accessing your account.

## I believe that someone has accessed my account

If you suspect that someone has accessed your account, **contact support immediately** by emailing support@stoa.money or calling +44 (0) 20 7959 3836 and we will take immediate action to safeguard your account.
