# Choose and redeem Perks

## How do I choose Perks?

You can choose from a wide selection of Perks by navigating to the _Explore_ page. Recall that **1 Perk = 1 Pot = 1 Deposit**, and that you can make multiple deposits in one transaction payment.

## How do I redeem Perks?

As we offer a broad range of Perks, how each Perk is redeemed can vary according to the specific brand and how we make the perk available to you (for example, we make some Perks, such as ChatGPT, available to you using Apple App Store or Google Play Store credit). For every Perk on the platform, we provide to you a set of _Redemption Instructions_.

Our support team is available 8am – 11pm, Monday to Sunday, to be on hand to answer any queries and help you through the redemption process.

A general overview of the redemption process appears as follows:

1. After completing your transaction payment and Stoa successfully receiving your deposit(s), the process for acquiring your gift card code(s) is initiated. For some Perks, this is a manual process which is carried out by a support agent (usually takes up to 30 minutes), and for others this is programmatic (near-instant).
2. As soon as your gift card codes are ready, we will notify you via email. For some Perks, you will receive the gift card codes directly to your email, and for others you will need to access them by following the link to your _My Pots_ page.
3. For either scenario (where you receive the gift card codes directly or they are made available to you from your _My Pots_ page) – you will need to click _Activate_ for the relevant Pot and select _Reveal_. This lets us know that you have acknowledged receiving the code.
4. Follow the redemption instructions provided to you to redeem your Perk. These vary brand to brand, and whether the gift card is brand-enabled (such as Netflix, who offer their own gift card product), or Apple or Google-enabled (such as ChatGPT, which require Apple or Google Play Store credit to pay for the relevant subscription).
