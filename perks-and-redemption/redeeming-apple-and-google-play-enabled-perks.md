# Redeeming Apple and Google Play enabled Perks

## Perks that use an Apple gift card

For some Perks, we make these available to you using Apple gift cards. These include:

* Apple Subscriptions, such as: Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple iCloud+, and so on.
* Apple One Off Perks. These are Apple and Apple App Store.
* Apple (credit)-enabled Subscriptions. These are Perks that are available to purchase as app subscriptions from the Apple App Store, such as: ChatGPT, MyFitnessPal, The Guardian, and so on.
  * In most cases, this will also cover the "web version" of the Perk also. For example, if you pay for ChatGPT Plus using your Apple credit (by downloading and installing the ChatGPT app on your iPhone and purchasing ChatGPT Plus from there), you will also be able to use ChatGPT Plus on the web.
  * Every one of these Perks has an alternative Google Play Store counterpart, which you should choose instead if you are an Android user.

For additional information on what you can purchase use your Apple gift card or Apple Account balance, please see [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118245).

## How to use an Apple gift card to redeem your Perk

For reference, please see the instructions provided by Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/118242?device-type=iphone).

1. **Redeem the Apple gift card:**
   1. Open the **App Store** on iPhone or iPad.
   2. Tap your profile picture (top right).
   3. Tap **“Redeem Gift Card or Code”**.
   4. Enter the code. The balance is now added to your Apple ID account.
2. **Check that your Apple ID balance is visible:**
   1. In the App Store → tap profile → the **Apple ID balance** should now show under your name.
   2. This balance is what Apple uses first for app purchases and subscriptions.
3. **Start or renew your subscription:**
   1. Go to the relevant app (e.g., ChatGPT) → select the relevant subscription plan for which you have a Perk for (e.g., Plus plan).
   2. Confirm with Face ID / Touch ID.

#### How payment is applied

* Apple will always **use Apple ID balance first**.
* If your balance covers the full subscription cost, **no card is charged**.
* If your balance is not enough, Apple will charge the **remaining amount** to your backup payment method (for Apple devices, you will always need to choose a backup payment method).

#### Tips for making sure only your Apple gift card credit is used

* Make sure your **Apple ID balance is greater than or equal to the subscription price** (e.g., £19.99/month for ChatGPT Plus).&#x20;
* When you're approaching the end of your Pot, we will reach out to you again about what you would like next for your Pot and deposit. So, you will be reminded ahead of time.
* If you don’t want Apple to ever charge your card, you can temporarily **remove your payment method** from Apple ID settings, so subscriptions only succeed if covered by gift card credit.

## Perks that use a Google Play gift card

For some Perks, we make these available to you using Google Play gift cards. These include:

* Google and Google-affiliated Subscriptions, such as: Google One, YouTube Premium, and YouTube Music.

* Google Play (credit)-enabled Subscriptions. These are Perks that are available to purchase as app subscriptions from the Google Play Store, such as: ChatGPT, MyFitnessPal, The Guardian, and so on.

For example, if you pay for ChatGPT Plus using your Google Play Store credit (by downloading and installing the ChatGPT app on your Android device and purchasing ChatGPT Plus from there), you will also be able to use ChatGPT Plus on the web.
  * Every one of these Perks has an alternative Apple App Store counterpart, which you should choose instead if you are an iPhone user.
