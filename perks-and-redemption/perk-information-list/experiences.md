### Pot Info

[**Ticketmaster**](https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk) is a leading global ticketing platform that connects fans with their favourite artists, sports teams, and live events — from concerts and theatre to festivals and more.

For every **£50** of gift card value, you'll need a **£1,000** deposit.\
For example, a £50 card requires £1,000, a £100 card requires £2,000, and a £150 card requires £3,000.

Your deposit is held securely for **12 months**.\
Thirty days before your Pot is due to mature, you’ll have two options:

* **Renew** for another 12-month term (you may need to adjust your deposit amount based on the latest Perk value), or
* **Withdraw** your deposit once the 12-month term has elapsed.
