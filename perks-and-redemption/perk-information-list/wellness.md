### Pot Info

[**Treatwell**](https://www.treatwell.co.uk) is Europe’s leading online platform for booking hair, beauty, and wellness treatments — making it easy to discover and schedule appointments at thousands of trusted salons and spas near you.

For every £50 of gift card value, you'll need a £1,000 deposit.\
For example, a £50 card requires £1,000, a £100 card requires £2,000, and so on. The maximum you can deposit is £200,000 for £10,000 worth of credit (may be distributed to you in multiple cards).

Your deposit is held securely for 12 months.\
Thirty days before your Pot is due to mature, you’ll have two options:

* **Renew** for another 12-month term (you may need to adjust your deposit amount based on the latest Perk value), or
* **Withdraw** your deposit once the 12-month term has elapsed.
