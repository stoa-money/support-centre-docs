### Pot Info

[**Duolingo**](https://www.duolingo.com) is the world’s most popular language learning app, offering fun, bite-sized lessons that help you build real-world communication skills in over 30 languages.

With this Pot, you can unlock a Duolingo Plan by depositing the required amount into your Stoa account.\
For example, a £1,500 deposit unlocks a Duolingo Super Individual plan worth £68.99, giving you 12 months of ad-free learning, unlimited hearts, and access to all premium features.

Your deposit is held securely for 12 months.\
Thirty days before your Pot is due to mature, you’ll have two options:

* **Renew** for another 12-month term (you may need to adjust your deposit amount based on the latest Perk value), or
* **Withdraw** your deposit once the 12-month term has elapsed.
