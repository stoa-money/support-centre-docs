1. Redeem your Google Play gift card credit to your account by going to [play.google.com/redeem](https://play.google.com/redeem) and following the on-screen instructions (ensure that you are logged in to the account you intend to redeem the credit to).
2. Go to [one.google.com/plans](https://one.google.com/plans) and select the chosen plan for which you have a relevant Perk for. If you are not already signed in, you will be prompted to sign in. If you cannot see your plan immediately, click "more options" at the bottom for an expanded view.
3. In the payment window, tap the right-arrow symbol![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)and ensure your Google Play balance is turned on.
4. Proceed with the payment – when you are charged, Google will draw down from your Google Play balance before charging your card. Don't worry – provided that your Google Play balance is sufficient (which it should be from the Google Play gift card provided to you), your linked card will not be charged.
