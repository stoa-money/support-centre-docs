## Netflix

Please see information from the Netflix Help Centre [here](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/32950).

### For New Netflix Users

1. **Find your code**\
   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Netflix → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Go to Netflix redeem**\
   On a web browser (not the TV app), visit **netflix.com/redeem**.
3. **Enter the code**\
   Paste your gift card code and continue.
4. **Create your Netflix account**\
   Choose **Create account**, enter your **email** and **password**, and verify if asked.
5. **Pick a plan & start watching**\
   Select a plan. Your **gift card balance** will be applied first; when it runs out, you can add another gift card or a payment method to continue.

**Notes**

* The code must be redeemed in the **same country/region** the card was issued for.
* If you’re prompted for a card, look for **“Pay with a gift code”** or redeem at **netflix.com/redeem** first, then finish signup.
* Having trouble (invalid/already used/region message)? Double-check the code and region; if it persists, contact Stoa Support.

### For Existing Netflix Users

1. **Find your code**\
   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Netflix → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Sign in and redeem**\
   On a web browser, go to **netflix.com/redeem**, **sign in** to your existing account, and enter the code. Confirm if prompted.
3. **What happens next**\
   Your **gift balance** is added to your account. Future monthly charges will be taken from this balance until it runs out. If your account is **on hold**, the balance is used to clear what’s due and **reactivate** service.
4. **If you’re billed by a third party**\
   If your Netflix is billed via **Apple, Google Play, Sky/BT, or your broadband/TV provider**, gift cards don’t apply until you switch to **direct billing**. Cancel with that provider (let service run until the end), then log back into Netflix and redeem at **netflix.com/redeem**; your balance will then be used for future payments.
5. **Region & troubleshooting**\
   Codes must match your **country/region**. If you see “invalid/already used,” double-check the code and account email. Still stuck? Contact **Stoa Support** with your Pot ID so we can help.

## Spotify

Please see information from the Spotify Help Centre [here](https://support.spotify.com/uk/article/gift-cards/).

### For New Spotify Users

1. **Find your code**\
   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Spotify → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Create your Spotify account & redeem**\
   On a web browser (not the app), visit **spotify.com/redeem**. Choose **Create account**, then paste your gift card code and follow the prompts.
3. **Start Premium**\
   Your code pre-pays **Premium Individual**. When the balance runs out, you can add another gift card or a payment method to keep Premium active.

**Notes (new users)**

* Gift cards generally work for **Premium Individual only** and **don’t** apply to **Family/Duo/Student** or **free trials**.
* The code must match your **country/region**.

### For Existing Spotify Users

1. **Find your code**\
   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Spotify → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Redeem**\
   On a web browser, go to **spotify.com/redeem**, **sign in**, enter the code, and confirm.
3. **What happens next**\
   Your balance is applied to your account and future **Premium Individual** charges are taken from this balance until it’s used up.

**Notes (existing users)**

* If you pay Spotify via **Apple/Google Play/phone or broadband provider**, gift cards won’t apply. Cancel with that provider and let your plan end; once your account reverts to Free, redeem at **spotify.com/redeem** and return to **direct billing**.
* Gift cards generally **can’t** be used on **Family/Duo/Student** plans or **trial offers**.
* Region must match your **account country**.

If anything doesn’t work (e.g., “ineligible/region” messages), send Support your **Pot ID**, the **error text**, and **country**—we’ll help you sort it fast.

## YouTube Premium

### For New YouTube Premium Users

1. Go to [youtube.com/redeem](https://youtube.com/redeem) and enter your code. Follow the on-screen instructions. (Alternatively, you can redeem via the Google Play store by heading to [play.google.com/redeem](https://play.google.com/redeem) or via the Google Play Store app if you are on an Android device).
2. Go to [youtube.com/premium](https://youtube.com/premium) and select the relevant plan for which you have a Perk for (if your Perk is YouTube Premium Individual, for example, then you should select that plan). You might be eligible for a free 1 month trial period – if so then it will take 1 month for your Google Play balance to be drawn down from.
3. When the payment window appears,  tap the right arrow button![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)and select your Google Play balance.
4. Once selected click "BUY" (ensure that your Google Play balance is shown).

### For Existing YouTube Premium Users

If you already have an active YouTube Premium subscription paid via your card, you’ll need to switch your payment method to your Google Play balance before redeeming your gift credit.

1. Cancel your current YouTube Premium subscription:
   * Go to [YouTube Purchases](https://www.youtube.com/purchases) or open the YouTube app.
   * Tap your profile picture → Purchases and memberships → YouTube Premium → Deactivate.
   * Your Premium access will continue until the end of your current billing period.
2. Redeem your Google Play gift credit:
   * Open the Google Play Store app.
   * Tap your profile icon → Payments & subscriptions → Redeem code, then enter your gift code.
   * The balance will be added to your Google Play account.
3. Restart your YouTube Premium subscription:
   * Once your previous plan expires, go to [YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium). (Don't worry - because you can reactivate as soon as your existing plan expires, you should have minimal service interruption).
   * Choose the relevant plan (for which you have a Perk for) and ensure that Google Play balance is selected as your payment method.
4. You’ll now be billed from your Google Play balance instead of your card until your credit runs out.
