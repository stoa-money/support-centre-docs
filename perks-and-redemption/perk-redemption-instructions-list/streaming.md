## Netflix

Please see information from the Netflix Help Centre [here](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/32950).

### For New Netflix Users

1. **Find your code**\
   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Netflix → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Go to Netflix redeem**\
   On a web browser (not the TV app), visit **netflix.com/redeem**.
3. **Enter the code**\
   Paste your gift card code and continue.
4. **Create your Netflix account**\
   Choose **Create account**, enter your **email** and **password**, and verify if asked.
5. **Pick a plan & start watching**\
   Select a plan. Your **gift card balance** will be applied first; when it runs out, you can add another gift card or a payment method to continue.

**Notes**

* The code must be redeemed in the **same country/region** the card was issued for.
* If you’re prompted for a card, look for **“Pay with a gift code”** or redeem at **netflix.com/redeem** first, then finish signup.
* Having trouble (invalid/already used/region message)? Double-check the code and region; if it persists, contact Stoa Support.

### For Existing Netflix Users

1. **Find your code**\
   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Netflix → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Sign in and redeem**\
   On a web browser, go to **netflix.com/redeem**, **sign in** to your existing account, and enter the code. Confirm if prompted.
3. **What happens next**\
   Your **gift balance** is added to your account. Future monthly charges will be taken from this balance until it runs out. If your account is **on hold**, the balance is used to clear what’s due and **reactivate** service.
4. **If you’re billed by a third party**\
   If your Netflix is billed via **Apple, Google Play, Sky/BT, or your broadband/TV provider**, gift cards don’t apply until you switch to **direct billing**. Cancel with that provider (let service run until the end), then log back into Netflix and redeem at **netflix.com/redeem**; your balance will then be used for future payments.
5. **Region & troubleshooting**\
   Codes must match your **country/region**. If you see “invalid/already used,” double-check the code and account email. Still stuck? Contact **Stoa Support** with your Pot ID so we can help.

## Spotify

### For New Spotify Users

2. **Create your Spotify account & redeem**\
   On a web browser (not the app), visit **spotify.com/redeem**. Choose **Create account**, then paste your gift card code and follow the prompts.
3. **Start Premium**\
   Your code pre-pays **Premium Individual**. When the balance runs out, you can add another gift card or a payment method to keep Premium active.

**Notes (new users)**

* Gift cards generally work for **Premium Individual only** and **don’t** apply to **Family/Duo/Student** or **free trials**.
* The code must match your **country/region**.

### For Existing Spotify Users

   Open the Stoa email or go to **My Pots → Spotify → Reveal** to copy your gift card code.
2. **Redeem**\
   On a web browser, go to **spotify.com/redeem**, **sign in**, enter the code, and confirm.
3. **What happens next**\
   Your balance is applied to your account and future **Premium Individual** charges are taken from this balance until it’s used up.

**Notes (existing users)**

* If you pay Spotify via **Apple/Google Play/phone or broadband provider**, gift cards won’t apply. Cancel with that provider and let your plan end; once your account reverts to Free, redeem at **spotify.com/redeem** and return to **direct billing**.
* Gift cards generally **can’t** be used on **Family/Duo/Student** plans or **trial offers**.
* Region must match your **account country**.

If anything doesn’t work (e.g., “ineligible/region” messages), send Support your **Pot ID**, the **error text**, and **country**—we’ll help you sort it fast.
