## ChatGPT (iPhone / Apple App Store)

A set of generalised redemption instructions, for Perks that we make available to you using Apple gift cards, can be found [here](../redeeming-apple-and-google-play-enabled-perks.md#how-to-use-an-apple-gift-card-to-redeem-your-perk).

ChatGPT has included instructions on how to upgrade on the iOS app [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7905739-chatgpt-ios-app-upgrading-to-a-paid-subscription).

Note that, to upgrade to ChatGPT Pro, you must already be a ChatGPT Plus user on the iOS app (you cannot upgrade directly from the free tier to the Pro tier – you have to upgrade to Plus first).

### For New ChatGPT Users

1. Redeem your Apple App Store gift card balance to your Apple account.
2. Download the ChatGPT app from the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/chatgpt/id6448311069).
3. Sign in or create an account.
4. Find the ChatGPT Plus plan – either follow the advertisement in-app, or go to **Your Account > Upgrade.**
5. Make sure that you have selected the correct plan for which you have the relevant Perk for. For new users, you can only select to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus (for ChatPT Pro, you will need to upgrade to the Plus plan first).
6. Confirm with Face ID / Touch ID. You will have had to select a specific payment card on your Apple Account – don't worry, **Apple will always use the Apple Account balance first** (which you applied in the first step).
7. You have now redeemed your Perk – enjoy! Just a reminder: Apple will only charge your card if your Apple Account balance is insufficient. When you're approaching the end of your Pot, we will reach out to you again about what you would like next for your deposit, so we will remind you ahead of time.

### For Existing (Paying) ChatGPT Users

If you started your billing with ChatGPT on the web, you will need to cancel your existing paid plan and re-enrol via the ChatGPT app on your iPhone.

* Don't worry – you should have minimal service interruption. As soon as your paid plan ends on the web, simply follow the instructions we have provided [For New ChatGPT Users](ai-tools.md#for-existing-paying-chatgpt-users).

If you are already a paying ChatGPT customer via the app on your iPhone, then you need only to simply redeem the Apple gift card to your Apple Account as normal. Once the credit has been applied, when you are billed, the amount will be taken from you Apple Account balance.

Ensure that you are enrolled in the correct plan (the price displayed should match your Perk Value).

## Claude

Stoa will send you a Claude gift subscription (which behaves identically to a regular, paid Claude subscription)—here's how to redeem it and start using Claude.

### How to redeem your gift <a href="#h_82c3006095" id="h_82c3006095"></a>

1. Open the gift email or link you received.
2. Click “Redeem your gift.”
3. Sign in to your Claude account, or create a new account if you don't have one.
4. Confirm redemption.
5. You can also redeem directly at [claude.ai/gift/redeem](https://claude.ai/gift/redeem) and enter your gift code.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Your gift link will expire 365 days after the purchase date. It’s not possible to redeem multiple gifts at one time or stack redemptions.

### What happens when you redeem <a href="#h_7b6919fc8e" id="h_7b6919fc8e"></a>

Your experience depends on your current subscription status:

**If you're a new or free user:** Your account is upgraded to the gifted plan immediately. You'll have full access for the duration of the gift.

**If you're a Pro subscriber (web) and receive a Pro gift:** Your Pro subscription is extended by the gift duration.

**If you're a Pro subscriber (web) and receive a Max gift:** You're upgraded to the Max plan for the gift duration. When the gift ends, your Pro subscription resumes. Any unused time from your Pro billing cycle is added as account credit.

**If you're a Max subscriber (web) and receive a lower-tier gift:** The gift value is converted to account credit, which is automatically applied to your future invoices.

**If you're a Max subscriber (web) and receive the same or higher Max tier:** Your Max subscription is extended or upgraded accordingly.
