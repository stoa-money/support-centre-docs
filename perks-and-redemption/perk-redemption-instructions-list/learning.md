## Duolingo (Apple App Store)

A set of generalised redemption instructions, for Perks that we make available to you using Apple gift cards, can be found [here](../redeeming-apple-and-google-play-enabled-perks.md#how-to-use-an-apple-gift-card-to-redeem-your-perk).

For additional information from the Duolingo Help Centre, please see [here](https://www.duolingo.com/help).

### For New Duolingo Users

1. Redeem your Apple App Store gift card balance to your Apple account.
2. Download the Duolingo app from the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128).
3. Sign in or create an account. (You may have to do an introductory tutorial first).
4. Find the relevant plan in-app for which you have a Perk for.
5. Make sure that you have selected the correct plan for which you have the relevant Perk for. Proceed to the payment window.
6. Confirm with Face ID / Touch ID. You will have had to select a specific payment card on your Apple Account – don't worry, **Apple will always use the Apple Account balance first** (which you applied in the first step).
7. You have now redeemed your Perk – enjoy! Just a reminder: Apple will only charge your card if your Apple Account balance is insufficient. When you're approaching the end of your Pot, we will reach out to you again about what you would like next for your deposit, so we will remind you ahead of time.

_Note: If you are a new Duolingo user for a Super Individual plan, we will instead email across a gift card (this only applies to this specific plan and new users)._

### For Existing (Paying) Duolingo Users

If you started your billing with ChatGPT on the web, you will need to cancel your existing paid plan and re-enrol via the Duolingo app on your iPhone.

* Don't worry – you should have minimal service interruption. As soon as your paid plan ends on the web, simply follow the instructions we have provided [For New Duolingo Users](learning.md#for-new-duolingo-users).

If you are already a paying Duolingo customer via the app on your iPhone, then you need only to simply redeem the Apple gift card to your Apple Account as normal. Once the credit has been applied, when you are billed, the amount will be taken from you Apple Account balance.

Ensure that you are enrolled in the correct plan (the price displayed should match your Perk Value).
