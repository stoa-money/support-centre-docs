# Gift card issues

## How soon will I receive my gift cards?

Most are delivered manually by a support agent and usually arrive within 30 minutes. If you open a Stoa Pot after 11pm UK time (Monâ€“Sun), the gift card may be delivered after 8am the next day. Please make sure to watch your inbox (and spam).

## I am experiencing issues redeeming my Perk

If the gift card provided to you is a brand gift card (i.e., it is a product of the brand, such as in the case of Netflix or Spotify), then it may be helpful to look at any resources the brand has available regarding how to redeem your gift card first. If you are still facing difficulties redeeming, then reach out to our support team and we will be happy to help.
